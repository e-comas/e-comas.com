e-Comas is working with SEOPhenix to provide an Amazon listings generator for our clients.

Based on an existing SEOPhenix genAI tool built for Shopify, the Listings Generator produces the title, bullet points and description specifically for Amazon ASINs, saving hours of time.

It’s the latest addition to e-Comas’s growing suite of data and tech tools, designed to make selling on Amazon more efficient and profitable.

### How does it work?

The SEOPhenix Listings Generator is template-based. You give it an ASIN and it provides AI-generated text to populate the listing for that ASIN.

What’s special about it is that it takes content from several different sources, including the D2C website and social media, as well as content and keywords fed directly to it.

It’s able to assess the persona of your products and website, plus what customers use your product for, to generate content that reflects your brand. 

It even takes into account negative elements, such as bad feedback and brand guidelines about what not to say about the product.

Content managers can spend just a few minutes generating the listing and then manually checking it for errors and hallucinations, rather than the two-three hours it takes to write a listing from scratch.

e-Comas is offering the SEOPhenix Listings Generator at 10€ per listing, a huge saving over human listing creation. 

### What, and who, is it for?

The SEOPhenix tool is for the text of listings: the title, the bullet points, and the description.

It can’t do keyword research – yet – but it will incorporate the keywords you feed it.

It’s early days for AI-generated content, so we’re not promising the earth, here. It boosts a listing’s quality to around 7 or 8 on a scale of 1-10. It’s great for brands moving to Amazon who need a lot of content in a short time.

Theoretically it works in all languages, but the majority of our testing so far has been in English.

As with all AI-generated content, each listing needs checking by a human, but so far all our listings have been high quality.

Claudiu Clement, e-Comas’s CTO, says: “The Listings Generator is especially great for clients that are moving from D2C, for example, and don't have Amazon content, and want to create something quick and decent.

“It’s also good for brands that don't really pay much attention to their content, but they want to take it from a 3 to a 7 or 8. It might not be a 10, but you’re still improving it quite a lot.”

### e-Comas’s growing tech toolbox

The SEOPhenix Listings Generator is just one part of e-Comas’s growing tech toolkit.

As a data- and tech-focused agency, we’re building various tools to make selling on Amazon and other marketplaces more efficient and profitable for our clients.

We’re using these tools internally first, with plans to roll out to brand owners and other agencies once they’ve been thoroughly proven in-house.

One example is the e-Comas Content Tracker, which tracks any content changes on product detail pages, and allows streamlined updating between the live version of the content and the desired version.

We also have an Analytics Dashboard for brands, giving personalised insights into Amazon performance.

### And introducing…

We’ve got some more tech tools in the pipeline too.

Watch this space for a chatbot for sellers, connected to their Amazon accounts. More news on that will follow in the next few weeks.

We’re also building some more operational tools in-house, including inventory planning and sales forecasting tools. Again, these will first be used to make our agency more efficient in-house, before being made public.

Our plan is to roll out a full tech platform, e-Comas.Tech, within the next 12 months.

As CTO, Claudiu is spearheading the growth of e-Comas.Tech. He says: “We will keep adding tools to the toolbox, so that we end up with a full package for our clients to manage their eCommerce business. Account managers will have access to all these different knives so they can cut their meat how they want it. That’s the vision.”
