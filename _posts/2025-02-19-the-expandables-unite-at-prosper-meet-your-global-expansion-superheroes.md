Three industry powerhouses are teaming up to help eCommerce sellers break barriers and expand their brands on a global scale. [AVASK](https://avask.com/), [e-Comas](https://e-comas.com/) and [YLT Translations](https://ylt-translations.com/) - known collectively as The Expandables - are set to make a powerful impact at [Prosper Show 2025](https://prospershow.com/) on March 25-27 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Under the personas of General Compliance, Captain Expansion and Colonel Localization, these experts will guide brands through the essentials of international growth. Their goal? To challenge conventional thinking and prove why expanding into global markets is essential for brands that want to scale.

Meet the expansion superheroes:

**General Compliance (Melanie Shabangu, AVASK)**: The ultimate enforcer of seller success, ensuring businesses navigate tax, VAT and compliance requirements seamlessly.

**Captain Expansion (Jérôme de Guigné, e-Comas)**: A strategic force in global growth, helping brands smash through borders and maximize international potential.

**Colonel Localization (Jana Krekic, YLT Translations)**: The linguistic powerhouse who ensures brands communicate effectively in every new market.

Together, they challenge sellers with a bold message: *Do NOT expand internationally!* That is, unless you’re interested in:

* Unlocking new revenue streams
* Reaching a broader customer base
* Becoming a dominant global brand on Amazon.

“We’re thrilled to join forces at this year’s Prosper Show in Vegas,” says Jérôme de Guigné, e-Comas founder and CEO. “Bringing our expertise together means we can provide sellers with a truly comprehensive approach to international expansion, covering compliance, strategy and localization.”

eCommerce sellers ready to scale should mark their calendars for **Tuesday, March 25 at 2 PM**, when The Expandables take the stage to share their insights. Attendees can also meet The Expandables in person at **Booth #446** for expert guidance to launch their global growth journey.
