Now is the time to expand your brand globally on Amazon. That was the message from [The Expandables](https://e-comas.com/2025/02/19/the-expandables-unite-at-prosper-meet-your-global-expansion-superheroes.html) – your global expansion superheroes – at Prosper Show in Las Vegas last month.

The three industry powerhouses went with a mission: to challenge conventional thinking and prove why expanding into global markets is essential for brands that want to scale.

If you missed them at Prosper, here’s a recap of why 2025 is the perfect time to grow your brand internationally on the retail giant. 

### Reason #1: Amazon is growing and expanding to new regions

Amazon is bigger than ever. Revenue has consistently grown year on year, [hitting $637.96bn in 2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266282/annual-net-revenue-of-amazoncom/) - up from $574.78bn in 2023. Every region in the world has experienced [growth in the double digits](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/amazon-revenue-by-country) during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.

Here are the four countries with the [most Amazon sales in 2023:](https://www.blankspace.eu/blog-posts-en/amazon-marketplaces-worldwide)

* United States: $395.64bn 
* Germany: $81.97bn 
* United Kingdom: $33.59bn
* Japan: $26bn

And let’s not forget the size of the markets you can reach. 

Amazon has over [310 million active users globally](https://www.yaguara.co/amazon-statistics/). Around 230 million Amazon customers are from the United States. Amazon is the most popular European marketplace, with [1.2 billion monthly visitors](https://www.channelengine.com/en/blog/top-european-online-marketplaces#:~:text=%231:%20Amazon,more%20about%20selling%20on%20Amazon.) coming from the five largest countries alone (Germany, UK, France, Italy, and Spain).

Amazon’s growth shows no signs of slowing down any time soon as Amazon continues to expand into new marketplaces: the recent moves into Sweden, Belgium and Poland have all proved popular. And the latest launch in Ireland (amazon.ie) is an [exciting opportunity](https://avask.com/amazon-is-expanding-to-ireland/#:~:text=within%20the%20EU.-,The%20top%205%20benefits%20of%20the%20Amazon%20launch%20in%20Ireland,businesses%20to%20reach%20Irish%20customers.) for eCommerce businesses.

Obviously, the more countries Amazon sells into, the more chances sellers have of finding a new audience for their product. Which leads us to our next point…

### Reason #2: Global expansion is easier than ever

Amazon makes it very easy to expand into new territories thanks to its integrated logistics options like the [Global Logistics](https://sell.amazon.co.uk/amazon-global-logistics) and [Global Selling](https://sell.amazon.com/global-selling) programmes.

Of course, selling on Amazon isn’t exactly the same in every country. Certain Amazon markets have more or fewer tools than others - Amazon US is particularly tool-heavy, for example, because it gets all the seller tools in beta. But once you've mastered how to use Amazon in one country, you've pretty much got it. 

Tools that help you understand your customers in each country are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, which helps you tailor your products to multiple different markets and win global market share.

If you're using an agency, even better: you should only need to use one agency to reach every country served by Amazon, rather than a different agency in every country.

### Reason #3: Scaling carries less risk than before

Most good businesses have a fear of growing too fast: we all know what can happen when a brand expands faster than its operations, team structure and supply chain can handle. But we'd argue the risk of implosion from growing too fast is lower than it used to be, and certainly on Amazon. 

Why? Because Amazon is scalable: there's loads of data (and Amazon Marketing Cloud) to monitor and predict growth; there are lots of free tools to help create and optimise listings, some using genAI; and if you're selling more than you can make, you can stop your sales. 

What's more, expanding into different territories can help you gain first-mover advantage.

> e-Comas Founder, Jérôme de Guigné, says: “Being the first to introduce a product or service to a market allows you to establish brand recognition, customer loyalty and potentially set industry standards before competitors arrive.
>
> “If a new competitor comes, it will be tough to take you on all markets at the same time.”

We recommend starting with the US or the EU, depending on where you sell already, and taking it from there, but you could test your market in just one country, and move into more when you're ready. 

If you work with an agency that knows Amazon well, you've got an even better chance of scaling your business without damaging it.  

### Reason #4: Compliance is easier 

The biggest challenge for globally expanding brands is compliance across multiple countries with their own laws and customs. Tax, VAT and bureaucracy are the big themes here. 

We usually suggest starting your global expansion in either the US or the EU, depending on where you're based.

The US is the biggest global market, with no interior borders and tons of perks, such as all the tools in beta we mentioned earlier. 

And the EU is the world's largest trading bloc: most compliance-related tasks only have to be done once for all 27 countries. 

That doesn't mean you have to stop your global expansion there, though. We recommend using experts like [AVASK](https://avask.com/) to handle your compliance needs as you move into other Amazon markets, such as in Africa and Asia. 

### Reason #5: The localisation opportunity 

Naturally, one of the great challenges of moving into new countries is localising your listings - and sometimes your product range - to appeal to the new audience.

This is, on the face of it, easier than it used to be, with digital translation tools to help. But translation is only the start. Good localisation involves not only nailing the language, but becoming familiar with the culture. 

We think this is a major opportunity for brands. Badly-localised listings are common on Amazon: most of us have been turned off from buying a product because it was badly translated or the images didn't seem right, affecting our trust in the brand. You can make your products stand out among the competition by ensuring your translations are flawless, your understanding of the market is on point, and your messaging proudly reflects the place you're from.

Using a localisation agency such as [YLT Translations](https://ylt-translations.com/) can really help here. 

### Reason #6: Amazon's focus on individual brands

Shoppers love to buy from a brand with a story, and over the last few years Amazon has made extra efforts to ensure sellers can promote their own brand within the platform: through their brand store, through its social tools, through display advertising. 

That makes Amazon, in our opinion, the best place to showcase your brand to a global audience. 

You can tell your brand story across multiple marketplaces, adjusting your messaging to appeal to foreign audiences: for example, a Peruvian seller of health supplements emphasising the Peruvian ingredients in their products, and using the alpaca as an emblem in their marketing. 

#### Reason #7: You've got what it takes to be a global brand

When you started selling your product, did you dream of taking it worldwide?

If you're selling on Amazon, you've got the potential to reach that dream. All it takes is some logistics and operations planning, compliance knowledge, localisation know-how, data analysis, and a bit of clever marketing, and you can sell anywhere in the world… we believe in you!
