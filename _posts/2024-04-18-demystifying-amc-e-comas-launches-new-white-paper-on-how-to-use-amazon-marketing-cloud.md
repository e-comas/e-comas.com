Think data is a dry subject? It's not, it's magic.

But to most people – and most sellers on Amazon – the only way you can explain the magic of data is to show how it works in practice.

That's what our new white paper is all about. Written by e-Comas's own data wizard [Claudiu Clement](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudiu-clement/), 'AMC Unpacked: Demystifying 18 use cases of Amazon Marketing Cloud' \[link] shows sellers 18 different ways you can use AMC to improve your marketing game, maximise your ad spend and be more competitive in your category.

### 'Smarter spending decisions'

Claudiu says: “As the head of analytics at e-Comas, I get so excited about how AMC can be used by sellers to revolutionise their marketing. By being able to see correlations in different touchpoints of the customer's journey, and understand why some campaigns thrive while others don't, sellers can make smarter decisions on how to spend their ad budget.

“But it's hard to get that across to sellers without physically showing how it can work. That's what this white paper is for.

“We've delved into 18 use cases of AMC – from what touchpoints the customer hits on the path to conversion, to analysing reach and timing of individual campaigns and exploring keyword performance – in order to show just the kind of insights sellers can get from AMC, and how to apply them to their business.”

### Breaking down 18 use cases

Broken into 18 chapters, the white paper covers major AMC use cases that sellers can leverage to improve their ad budget efficiency.

For each use case, it explains:

* What the use case is and how it works
* Questions the use case can answer – such as how certain touchpoints affect the customer journey, and whether there are differences in conversion times for certain campaigns
* Examples of insights the use case can give you.

This information is presented clearly and concisely to give sellers an immediate idea of the kind of data they can get from AMC, and how they can use it to make advertising decisions.

### The 18 use cases of AMC

The use cases covered in the e-Comas white paper are:

* Path-to-conversion – understanding the customer's buying journey
* Conversion Time – understanding how long it takes for customers to convert
* Frequency – understanding how often customers encounter your ads
* New-to-brand – understanding how many purchases are new customers and how many are repeat buyers
* ASIN Overlap – understanding which products customers typically buy together
* Branded Searches – understanding whether your ad campaigns prompt brand keyword searches
* Incremental Reach and Timing of Exposures – understanding the impact of one Amazon campaign compared to another
* Sponsored Ads Keywords – understanding how your keyword targeting affects conversion, even indirectly
* Grocery Analysis – understanding ad-attributed sales online but also in physical locations like Whole Foods Market
* ASIN Analysis New-to-brand – understanding which ASINs effectively attract new-to-brand customers
* Audience Measurement – understanding how segmenting your audiences affects performance of your campaigns
* Cost Analysis – understanding total cost per conversion, average bid, and win price
* Custom Attribution – understanding how different attribution models, such as first touch or last touch, impact your ad campaigns
* Customer Value – understanding ad-exposed and non-ad exposed ASIN purchases, to identify customer segments with the highest purchase values
* Daily Performance – understanding the impact of advertising on various types of Amazon conversions
* Device Analysis – understanding how shoppers move between devices – such as PCs, phones and TVs – as they move towards purchase
* Geo Location – understanding your campaign performance based on precise geographical insights
* Performance Deep Dive – understanding your campaigns' effectiveness across different operating systems and device types.

### More competitive with data

Claudiu adds: “In today's eCommerce environment, it's the sellers who know how to interpret and use their sales data that will see the best results from their ad campaigns. And those sellers will be more competitive against other sellers in their category.

“We get that data analysis can be daunting to a lot of people, but AMC makes it simple and it's totally worth getting to know the basics so you can make smarter decisions on your advertising.

“We hope sellers find this white paper useful in detangling the perceived complexities around Amazon data and AMC, and find their ad spend goes much further as a result.”
