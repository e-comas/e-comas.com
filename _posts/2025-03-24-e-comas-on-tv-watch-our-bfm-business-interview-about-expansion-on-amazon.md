Did you catch us on TV?

e-Comas founder Jérôme de Guigné was recently invited onto French TV's leading business channel [BFM Business](https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/), to talk about how to accelerate your business with Amazon and other key marketplaces.

Appearing on the programme Paroles d'Entreprises, presented by Vincent Touraine, Jérôme talked about why Amazon is an ideal platform for brands, large and small, to expand globally – and why e-Comas is the ideal partner to help them do it. 

Jérôme looked right at home, betraying no nerves as he shared the eCommerce expertise and wisdom he's famous for. 

Here's a quick rundown of the main points he talked about.

### Point 1: Retail media is the future of eCommerce advertising.

The [retail media market in France](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1369384/change-retail-media-ad-spend-france/) alone is worth a billion euros, and grew 23% last year: it’s predicted to grow 25% this year.

The principles of retail media networks are advertising to customers at points of sale, using data, and considering the shopper’s journey as a whole – that’s what drives results for sellers and enables them to grow quickly.

### Point 2: Shoppers search first on Amazon before going to Google.

Research has shown the shift over recent years to Amazon as the place shoppers start a search for a product, before Google.

Most research shows that people shopping online will start at Amazon over search engines, other marketplaces like Walmart, YouTube or Facebook.

[JungleScout says 56% of consumers](https://www.junglescout.com/resources/articles/amazon-statistics-2024/) start their product search on Amazon.

### Point 4: Amazon has the most growth.

Amazon is getting bigger and bigger. Revenue has consistently grown year on year, [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266282/annual-net-revenue-of-amazoncom/), hitting $637.96bn in 2024 – up from $574.78bn in 2023.

Amazon also allows brands to develop internationally in as simple a way as possible, says Jérôme: “That's what makes Amazon interesting for the smaller brands, that don't have the reach that the big brands have.”

### Point 4: e-Comas is growing too.

Since its inception 12 years ago, e-Comas has become one of the most prominent eCommerce agencies in the world, offering our customers unrivalled opportunities for growth on Amazon.

Our fantastic multi-lingual, multi-skilled team are all trained specialists in using data to drive sales and accelerate our clients’ business.

We are investing in services around social networks, automation using data and AI, and our growing team based in offices around the world.

### 'Representing e-Comets and our customers'

Jérôme says: "I was thrilled to be invited onto the Paroles d'Entreprises programme, and so proud and honoured to represent all the e-Comets and our great customers who have made e-Comas what it is today.

"It's always been my dream to be on Saturday night TV, and I can’t think of a better channel than BFM Business to achieve the dream on.

“Any chance to highlight Amazon’s potential as a growth enabler for businesses is fantastic for me, and I hope I demonstrated to the thousands of viewers that e-Comas is an ideal partner for leveraging that potential.

“Thanks so much to BFM Business, the producers and the charming Vincent Touraine for having me. I’ll come back any time – I could get used to the TV lifestyle!”
