For US sellers, manufacturing in Asia to sell on [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com) just got a lot more complicated – and costly. 

Trump's tariff regime has seen alarming price rises for manufacturers and consumers alike. In fact, the average US tariff rate on all goods from overseas is at its highest level since 1934: 18.2%, [according to the Budget Lab at Yale](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-july-28-2025).

Manufacturers often have no choice but to pass on these higher costs to their customers, with dire consequences in terms of brand loyalty and cut-price competition. 

But the tariff war isn't the only compelling financial reason to start investigating US production.

If you're selling on Amazon in the US, and you want to stay competitive, it may be time to start manufacturing closer to home – for brand protection and reputation, as well as cost. 

### The effects of the tariff war

Trump started waging his tariff war in April, starting with China and spreading to almost every country in the world. 

Since then, most goods coming into the US have faced taxes of 10% or more, with plans to levy even higher tariffs from this month – up to 50%. 

Most US manufacturers have already taken a painful hit to their bottom line, from small Amazon sellers to giants like Hasbro and General Motors. 

Economists predict slower growth and lower investment in the USA as a result. 

What's the point of the tariffs? [The BBC reports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqx2xx8qpl4o) that the US government has already collected a record $100bn in tariff revenue this year, which is one motive.

But the other motive is to encourage more domestic manufacturing in the US – which we think is very worthwhile, and not just to avoid the tariffs. Here's why you should investigate US manufacturing options. 

### The hidden costs of manufacturing overseas 

When comparing quotes across different manufacturers, it’s easy to focus on unit price. But the hidden costs of low-cost vendors overseas often show up later in delays, compliance issues, or poor product performance.

Our friends at GP Labs, a private label manufacturer with facilities in both Florida & Georgia, have provided this table to show what's actually included in their full-service, North American manufacturing quote – and what’s usually missing from those that come in 5-6 times cheaper.
