Ask anyone who knows anything about selling on Amazon and they’ll tell you: you can’t make money on Amazon unless you pay for advertising. 

It’s one of history’s most competitive marketplaces. As well as the fact you’re sharing the space with dozens of brands selling the same types of product as you, Amazon has designed the platform to make shopping as easy as possible for customers - meaning they’ll often only see a handful of the options before buying. 

For small businesses, without the brand recognition of bigger competitors, advertising on Amazon is even more important. It’s your best chance of getting your product in front of your target audience. And there are ways to advertise, and to measure your advertising, that ensure it’s cost-effective and worthwhile. 

Invest £5,000 in Amazon Ads and you’re likely to see not only a healthy ROI, but exactly how and why your investment has performed. 

The trick is to strategise. 

This blog will cover:

* The best Amazon keyword research tools
* How to optimise your listings on Amazon
* Types of Amazon ads
* How to optimise Amazon budget
* How to measure Amazon advertising results.

### Understand Your Goals and Audience

Advertising on Amazon works best if you have a strong strategy to work to.

First, define your objectives. What do you want from your ad campaigns? Simply more purchases? Better brand awareness? Or are you hoping to gain more repeat customers? 

You also need to identify your target audience. [Knowing who your customers are on Amazon](https://e-comas.com/2024/04/18/how-to-understand-your-customers-on-amazon-and-why-you-should.html) can help you determine the best audiences to target in your ads, and the pathways you can take to reach them. 

For example, you can use data to find out if your customers are coming to your products through DSP ads, TV ads or Sponsored Brands, or a combination - but we’ll look at that in more depth later.

### Conduct Keyword Research

Keyword research is vital for selling on Amazon. The more relevant keywords you include in your listings, and advertise against, the more successful your adverts are likely to be. 

While you can probably think of 10-20 relevant keywords for your ASIN, keyword research tools will find you hundreds more, and rank them by how relevant they are to your products and your competitors’ products. The relevance of your keywords should even help you write your listings’ bullets and descriptions. 

When advertising on Amazon, the most high-converting keywords should take priority - but keyword research tools can also help you find more unusual keywords to use that give you an edge over the competition. 

Our favourite keyword research tools are [M19](https://www.m19.com/), [Helium 10](https://www.helium10.com/) and [Jungle Scout](https://www.junglescout.com/). 

### Optimise Your Product Listings

You can do the best keyword research in the world, and you can spend thousands advertising your Amazon products, but without optimising your listings to maximise conversion, you won’t see the return on investment. Shoppers might land on your listings and be put off by poor product descriptions and bad-quality photos. 

Optimising your product listings is one of the simplest ways to improve your ad performance. 

There are five areas to concentrate on for each listing: the title, images, bullet points, description and A+ content. 

These are our top tips: 

* Don't let your product title get too wordy. It's tempting to shoehorn in as many keywords as possible - but just use your best keywords and save the rest for the bullet points. A title shouldn't be more than 15 words. 
* Ensure each of your bullet points promotes a USP or addresses a specific customer pinch point. Check your competitors' reviews to find out what exactly shoppers want from your product, and make sure you mention it.
* Use A+. An [Amazon study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoskdCF3Z8k) found that this brochure-style content below the fold typically boosts sales by 5%: it helps shoppers get a feel for the product, and gives you a chance to tell your brand story.

### Start with Automatic Campaigns

The best way to start advertising on Amazon is with automatic campaigns. 

These allow Amazon's algorithm to assign relevant keywords to your Sponsored Products campaigns. It's great for gaining an understanding of what targeting works best for your products, and data on which keywords to use. When you have sufficient data you can move on to manual campaigns, which give you greater control over keyword targeting and bidding. 

Once you've established your auto campaigns, there's no need to turn them off. We recommend minimising the budget, but always having auto campaigns in the background for keyword gathering.

### Tips for Automated Campaigns in the Early Stages

* **Ensure Sufficient Ad Delivery Time**: By managing bids and budgets, ensure your ads run for at least 20 hours a day to garner ample exposure opportunities.
* **Utilise Daily Budget**: Optimise your bids to fully utilise your daily budget. This highlights the appeal of your products and induces potential customers to respond.
* **Choose Best Suggested Bid**: Select "Best Suggested Bid" as your ad group bid, which is Amazon's recommended optimal bid based on your product and sales performance.
* **Prioritise Phrase and Broad Match**: In the first 2-3 weeks, targeting "Phrase Match" and "Broad Match" keywords will be a good strategy. This helps your ads gain wider exposure and gather more data.

### Other Tips for Automated Campaigns

* **Maintain your Bids and Budgets**: Continue running ads for 7-10 days with relatively stable bids and budgets. This allows Amazon's algorithm to better understand your products and target audience.
* **Consider Similar and Related Products Ads**: If you have additional budget, targeting relative products can expand your ad reach. Especially in the initial stages of advertising, increased exposure helps attract more potential customers, promoting product awareness and sales.

Once you've established automated ad campaigns, making the most of the insights and data they offer could be important. However, managing and optimising ad campaigns can be time-consuming for many small to medium sellers, especially those less familiar with Amazon advertising.

This is why utilising automated Amazon PPC software can be a great solution. Take [M19](https://www.m19.com/) as an example: by leveraging AI automation and [machine learning](https://www.m19.com/blog/everyone-can-implement-automation-but-which-type-rules-based-or-machine-learning), we support sellers in managing daily budgets and achieving desirable ACoS targets without manual management. Additionally, you can [track your keywords](https://www.m19.com/products/product-keyword-tracker), ASINs performance and ad reporting in real time, so you can improve performance while saving time and effort.

### Monitor and Optimise Performance

It's easy to set up Amazon ad campaigns and then let them run without further attention. But this leads to wasted ad spend: to get maximum efficiency from your ad campaigns, it's important to keep monitoring them and optimising them. 

The most popular metrics for monitoring your ad campaigns' performance are: 

* **Click-through rate (CTR)**: this metric is calculated by how many clicks your ad gets divided by the number of impressions. For example, one click in 100 impressions gives you a CTR of 1%. The higher your CTR is, the more successful, attractive and/or relevant your ad has been to the audience.
* **Conversion rate (CVR)**: CVR is the percentage of page visits that resulted in a sale. It helps to show how well your listings and advertising are performing. 
* **Cost-per-click (CPC)**: CPC is the metric representing the amount you pay every time your ad is clicked on. You can measure the efficiency of your pay-per-click ad campaign by tracking the CPC: the more clicks you get, the lower the CPC will be and therefore the more successful your campaign.
* **Advertising Cost of Sales (ACoS)**: ACoS is the percentage of ad spend versus total sales - you can use it to measure how cost-efficient your advertising is. The lower your ACoS, the more efficiently your ads are performing. 

Besides tracking these four metrics, we recommend looking into these strategies:

* Trying different keyword match types to refine the target and the ad spend
* Product targeting - advertising your products on relevant product detail pages to reach potential customers who are actively browsing similar products
* Competitor analysis - keeping an eye on your competitors' strategies to make sure you are doing the same or better.

### Optimise Your Amazon Advertising Budget

Crafting a reasonable advertising budget is crucial for selling products on Amazon. Ad budgets not only impact your ad performance but also directly affect your profit margins. Using the example of selling phone cases, let's see how to calculate your Amazon advertising budget and provide optimisation tips.

### Calculate Ad Campaign Break-Even Point (BEP) Max Bid

The BEP max bid is a crucial factor in setting your advertising budget. It represents the maximum amount you're willing to pay per click without incurring losses. The calculation formula is:

BEP Max Bid = Average Gross Profit - Conversion Rate * Average CPC

Assuming you sell phone cases on Amazon with a $5 gross profit per unit, a 3% conversion rate, and an average CPC of $0.15, your ad campaign BEP max bid would be:

BEP Max Bid = $5 - 3% * $0.15 = $5 - $0.045 = $4.955

In actual sales, you'll have both organic orders (generated through non-ad channels like Amazon Search or recommendations) and ad-driven orders. If your organic order is 40%, your actual max bid could be closer to $0.3-$0.4.

### Optimise Your ACoS

ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales) is a vital metric for measuring advertising ROI. Lowering ACoS implies more efficient ad budget utilisation and improved profitability of your campaigns. Generally:

ACoS = Ad Spend / Sales Revenue

In other words, ACoS = CPC * Conversion Rate / Average Order Value

To optimise ACoS, consider these strategies:

* **Prioritise Low CPCs**: If you’re selling low-price products, aim for lower Cost-Per-Click (CPC) bids. This directly reduces your advertising expense per click, leading to a more profitable campaign overall.
* **Drive High Conversion Rates**: Another effective approach is to focus on maximising your conversion rate. When more clicks convert into actual sales, it improves overall ad performance and profitability. By achieving a higher conversion rate, you can effectively manage ACoS even with a lower average order value.

### Allocate Budget Wisely

Amazon offers a good range of [advertising solutions](https://advertising.amazon.com/lp/build-your-business-with-amazon-advertising?tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_10by7289pf_p_ps_gg_b_uk_en_d_core_p_653815769475&k_amazon%20ad%20services&group_146479246734). And different Amazon ad products suit different brands, ASINs and budgets.

Amazon's ad products include: 

* Sponsored Products - to boost individual listings
* [Sponsored Brands](https://www.m19.com/blog/amazon-sponsored-brands-ads) - to create brand awareness
* Sponsored Display - appear in front of shoppers as they're browsing elsewhere
* [Video ads](https://www.m19.com/blog/amazon-sponsored-video-ads) and audio ads - streamed between content on Amazon-owned TV and audio platforms
* DSP - Programmatic display advertising to reach audiences on and off Amazon. 

Finding the best ad solutions for your product means you can allocate your budget more smartly. Your advertising will be more efficient, and your ROAS will be higher. 

We use data to do this: use the client's specific goals to decide which range of advertising options to try, then monitor their performance over time, and hone in on the best-performing ones. Start small, with Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands. 

Keep experimenting, monitoring and tweaking - a winning formula won't necessarily perform forever. 

Further down the line, a more sophisticated approach is to use AMC to see which advertising combinations perform best to move shoppers towards a purchase, and allocate budget based on that.

### Track and Measure Results

We can't overemphasise that to have success with Amazon advertising, you need to keep an eye on the data and watch what happens. 

Tracking and measuring your ad campaigns is the only way to ensure they're performing well and doing what they're supposed to do, whether that's growing your new-to-brand sales or pushing up brand awareness.

Amazon offers its own advertising dashboard with campaign visibility and analytics tools, so you can easily see how your ads are performing. 

Then there's AMC, which is accessed via API. AMC converts reams of anonymised data into really useful insights, showing you the effect of your ads on shoppers through every phase of the marketing funnel. 

For example, AMC can tell you if shoppers are more likely to buy after seeing a certain combination of your ads, or whether they start searching for brand keywords after being exposed to a certain campaign.

You can also use an agency. At e-Comas we offer our in-house Compas dashboard, which connects dozens of different datasets across our clients' eCommerce, social media and advertising platforms to help them make informed data-driven decisions for their business.  <!--StartFragment-->
