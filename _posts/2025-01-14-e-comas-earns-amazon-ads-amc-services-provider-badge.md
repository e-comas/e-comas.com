The team at e-Comas are delighted to announce we've just gained the AMC Services Provider Badge.

AMC is Amazon Marketing Cloud, Amazon's data clean room service that allows advertisers to collect and analyse their sales data more precisely than ever before. 

In awarding us the AMC Services Provider Badge, Amazon Ads is accrediting e-Comas as a trusted, expert supplier of AMC services to our clients. 

### What does it mean for e-Comas?

As an Amazon Ads Amazon Marketing Cloud services provider, we gain coveted recognition for our AMC skills and know-how.

We're one of few Amazon Ads Partners to have gained the badge, which is displayed prominently on [our listing in Amazon Ads' partner directory](https://advertising.amazon.com/partners/directory/details/amzn1.ads1.ma1.cj3vydv54i8qcb80mhstj0em0/e-Comas-Sarl), a clear visual signal that e-Comas is an expert in Amazon Marketing Cloud. 

This expertise gives our clients a great advantage: Amazon sellers using AMC can leverage granular insights into their sales data to pinpoint shoppers along the marketing funnel, advertising to them in the most effective way possible. Using insights from AMC is proven to boost sales and improve ROAS. 

As well as the directory listing, we'll be using our new status as Amazon Ads AMC services provider across our marketing, promoting ourselves as a natural choice for any seller who wants to maximise their Amazon presence using data.

### 'The most data-driven agency in the world' 

e-Comas is on a mission to become the most data-savvy eCommerce agency in the world. 

We deliver continuous data training to our team, with every single one of our account managers and execs having studied an enhanced data literacy course delivered by our CTO Claudiu Clement. 

We are also highly invested in the use of AMC, always keeping up to date with its development and exploring the possibilities of what it can do. We recently published a white paper about how to use it, written by Claudiu: [AMC Unpacked: Demystifying 18 use cases of Amazon Marketing Cloud](https://e-comas.com/white-paper-form.html).

Jérôme de Guigné, e-Comas founder and CEO, says: "Being recognised with Amazon's AMC Service Provider Badge is a fantastic achievement for the whole team. Congrats and thank you to all the e-Comets, not least Clau and Sam \[Millendo, our PPC and data lead], for their dedication to making AMC work so hard for our clients."

### Criteria met by e-Comas

To gain the AMC Services Provider Badge, e-Comas had to meet various criteria from Amazon Ads. These include having a certain number of active AMC clients, and earning separate verifications within AMC such as 'Clean Room Developer'.

We've also qualified by having an AMC case study approved for publication on [Amazon Ads' website](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-gb/resources/library?subpageType=Education&relatedContentTypes=Case%20studies). Our case study is due to appear in Q1 of 2025 - watch this space!

Our dedication to AMC goes beyond the qualifying criteria, though: we were one of the happy few chosen to use AMC during its PPC-only beta phase; we've been investing in our AMC offering for years; and all our clients get access to AMC reports by default on our own dashboard. 

Jérôme adds: "All the e-Comets are trained to help Amazon sellers understand AMC, to give them full access to all their data, and to use it effectively - and we've been doing this for as long as AMC has been around. It's great to get this recognition for the team's hard work from Amazon Ads, and to be able to promote our specialism in this way to new and potential customers."

### Want to get big in 2025? Look for the Badge…

Claudiu Clement says: "Selling on Amazon has changed a lot in the last 10 years. The competition's huge in every category, so our clients have to work harder and smarter to ensure their ads are effective. But for us, that's where the fun is! 

"We can use data in amazing ways to improve our clients' ad performance. We can analyse so many different parts of our clients' sales on and off Amazon, and create genuine insights that actively boost performance. 

"For example, we can examine how different attribution models - first touch, last touch - affect campaigns. 

"We can segment audiences, and then measure how that segmenting affects performance across campaigns, so we can hone the campaigns that work. 

"We can measure how audiences shop across different devices and in different locations, and the difference ads make on each of those devices or in those locations. 

It's a lot of information – but if you've got an expert agency to analyse it and turn it into insights, it's invaluable to your business.

"For any Amazon seller looking to grow their business in 2025, using an agency with the AMC Service Provider Badge will make a huge difference."
