What a year it’s been for the eCommerce world!

For us at e-Comas, 2025 has been our biggest year yet: we’ve grown our team, expanded our operations, and are now in our best position ever to help brands scale and grow their business on Amazon and elsewhere.

2025 has also been a transformative year for our friends at AVASK, experts in eCommerce compliance, marked by innovation, strategic partnerships, and a relentless focus on empowering sellers to scale internationally with confidence.

Before we say “happy holidays and all the best for 2026”, let’s reflect, along with AVASK, on a busy, beautiful year full of innovation and growth for the industry.

### Headline news from e-Comas and AVASK

For us at e-Comas, we’ve got lots to reflect on fondly as 2025 closes. It’s been a year of great achievements, starting in January when we were made a verified Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) services provider, which means Amazon Ads has recognised us as being a great agency for making use of AMC – [they’ve given us a badge and everything](https://e-comas.com/2025/01/14/e-comas-earns-amazon-ads-amc-services-provider-badge.html).

In March we became superheroes, teaming up with AVASK as well as [YLT Translations](https://ylt-translations.com/) to appear as [‘The Expandables’](https://e-comas.com/2025/02/19/the-expandables-unite-at-prosper-meet-your-global-expansion-superheroes.html) at the Prosper Show. Our mission? To help sellers take their operation international. Great fun – and doesn’t the pants-over-tights look suit our CEO Jérôme de Guigné?

Also in March, Jérôme appeared on TV (though not as Captain Expansion, sadly). He took to the French business channel [BFM business](https://e-comas.com/2025/03/24/e-comas-on-tv-watch-our-bfm-business-interview-about-expansion-on-amazon.html) to discuss his passion: how to accelerate your business on Amazon.

Over the summer we were thrilled to [launch our latest white paper](https://e-comas.com/2025/09/09/test.html), about how to manage your content on Amazon. It acts as a complete guide to managing your product listings content with content syndication.

We also launched several of our own intelligent data and tech tools, such as the [SEOPhenix Listings Generator](https://e-comas.com/2025/09/03/seophenix-listings-generator-for-amazon-rolled-out-as-latest-e-comas-tech-tool.html), which allows brands to quickly and simply populate new product listings using AI.

A professional highlight for Jérôme was speaking at [Amazon Accelerate](https://e-comas.com/2025/10/02/ai-expansion-and-amazon-as-a-service-everything-we-learned-at-amazon-accelerate-2025.html): a fantastic show, and once again we were delighted to team up with AVASK for it.

Meanwhile, AVASK have continued to lead the way in VAT and EPR compliance solutions. Their [Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) services](https://avask.com/epr/) helped thousands of sellers navigate new regulations in the UK and EU, ensuring sustainability and cost efficiency.

AVASK also introduced an [insurance-backed solution for the Italian VAT Guarantee](https://avask.com/blog/avask-italian-vat-compliance/), significantly reducing upfront costs for businesses entering the Italian market and making compliance more accessible than ever.

### Challenges in the eCommerce world

There have been challenges for online retailers in the last year: political unrest and uncertainties, as well as tariffs and price increases in the supply chain, have all led to tighter budgets and more pressure on prices for sellers.

The increase in the number of sales event days, on Amazon as well as other marketplaces, has brought its own challenges. Higher competition, a longer duration for deals and longer lead-in and lead-out periods have created even more budget pressure and limited event efficiency.

Even small-seeming problems – like the tendency of Amazon to randomly use AI in automatic mode, changing attributes of products which then get flagged and blocked – have caused headaches for sellers. We’re hoping that last one, at least, gets sorted as soon as possible.

### And opportunities, of course

On the other hand, new opportunities for sellers are coming thick and fast. AI is helping to speed up operations across the board, from image generation to [AMC query building](https://e-comas.com/2025/11/24/unboxing-unboxed-2025-more-opportunities-more-data-more-ai.html).

Amazon is growing steadily in different markets across the world: Ireland’s Amazon.ie became its newest marketplace this year, and while the eCommerce giant is looking into possibilities to expand in the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia [over the next few years](https://amz-doc.com/amazons-global-expansion-entering-new-marketplaces-in-2025-beyond/), it also continues to grow consistently in its existing markets.

Amazon Ads is getting bigger, and expanding its reach, [incorporating Netflix](https://digiday.com/marketing/netflix-turns-to-amazon-to-make-its-ads-easier-to-buy/) into its programmatic buying network. Meanwhile, thanks to Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC), measurement of ad campaigns is better than ever, with full-funnel analysis and insights allowing sellers to refine their strategy. 

Tiffany Lemprière, e-Comas’s Head of Performance Marketing, says one of the best things about 2025 has been “the ability to accelerate on DSP activities, and use relevant AMC insights for greater efficiency.”

### The big surprises of 2025

Amazon still has the capacity to surprise us. “A lot of the announcements from unBoxed I did not expect,” says Jérôme: chiefly the integration of [DSP and PPC into one platform](https://e-comas.com/2025/11/24/unboxing-unboxed-2025-more-opportunities-more-data-more-ai.html), but also Sponsored Products video, which will allow more creative use of one of Amazon’s most popular placements.

Tiffany adds that the automated audience segments in Sponsored Display, DSP and AMC, which have made mid-funnel targeting more accessible, are a pleasant surprise: Sponsored Display gives AI audience signals; and auto-generated audiences are possible in DSP.

### The best announcements of 2025

Most of the e-Comas team agree that the best announcement from Amazon was the full-funnel integrated approach of putting DSP and PPC together on one platform, so sellers can leverage all the tools of Amazon in one place.

Another exciting one was AVASK introducing its [Shopify API integration for VAT compliance.](https://avask.com/blog/shopify-api-vat-compliance/) This feature allows sellers to automate VAT calculations and filings directly within their Shopify stores, reducing manual work and ensuring accuracy across multi-channel operations. 

Mike Thake, Head of Group Marketing at AVASK, says: “By connecting compliance seamlessly with eCommerce platforms, AVASK is helping brands focus on growth while staying fully compliant.”

### Anything expected in 2025 that didn’t happen?

We asked the team if they expected anything to happen in 2025 that didn’t happen. Jérôme says: “To become Miss Universe. A shame, really.”

### Professional highlights of the year

We asked the team for their professional highlights of 2025. Jérôme says: “Growing the team at e-Comas to become one of strongest eCommerce powerhouses on the market. Also speaking again at [Amazon Accelerate](https://e-comas.com/2025/10/02/ai-expansion-and-amazon-as-a-service-everything-we-learned-at-amazon-accelerate-2025.html) - oh, and appearing on TV!"

Mike Thake says: “Partnerships were at the heart of our strategy in 2025. At Prosper Show, AVASK joined forces with e-Comas and YLT Translations as part of The Expandables panel, challenging misconceptions about international expansion and sharing actionable insights for global growth.

“Later, at Amazon Accelerate, we offered exclusive expansion promos and co-hosted a webinar with e-Comas, focusing on AI-driven strategies to reduce barriers to cross-border selling.”

### Predictions for 2026 and beyond

We asked the team for their predictions for the New Year. Jérôme says: “Stronger but also better use of AI. Some things will work, some won’t.

“I also predict even more TV ads, even more DSP, and basically more full-funnel strategies than ever before.”

Tiffany says: “I predict better integration between Amazon ads and retail signals, with more predictive features, e.g. forecast of the demand.”

Mike says: “Community and growth remain central to our mission. Through [The Online Hustle Podcast](https://avask.com/the-online-hustle-podcast/), we explore topics from compliance to TikTok Shop strategies. We’re excited to kick off 2026 with a special episode featuring Jérôme de Guigné from e-Comas, who will dive into marketplace expansion trends.”

**To close the year, AVASK has launched its Holiday Savings promotion, available until 31 December 2025. Sellers can take advantage of special discounts on VAT and EPR services, making it the perfect time to prepare for 2026 expansion: <https://avask.com/holiday-savings-2025/>**
