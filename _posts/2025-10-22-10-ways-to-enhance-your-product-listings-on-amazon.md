When you’re selling online, your product listings content is critically important to your conversion rate.

Without a compelling listings page, it doesn’t matter how good your advertising is: your customers are likely to look elsewhere.

[According to Zoovu,](https://zoovu.com/lp/ultimate-guide-to-product-detail-pages?utm_term=best%20ecommerce%20product%20pages&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=NAM+United_Kingdom+AI+Config+GS&hsa_cam=21377089915&hsa_grp=161316424737&hsa_mt=p&hsa_src=g&hsa_ad=702030523917&hsa_acc=2358037484&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_kw=best%20ecommerce%20product%20pages&hsa_tgt=kwd-392015530264&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21377089915&gbraid=0AAAAAoKRmrARatlvTIl9vBafGSN3Dl9U7&gclid=CjwKCAjw0sfHBhB6EiwAQtv5qQUr5F-Sre1cEKxNuZ0bw8JE5P9LbDteTCJdtvHs5qMLGX-bvUPo3RoCPPIQAvD_BwE) the average listings page contains 59 pieces of information, including product specifications, images, related products, and more.

Laying out all that information so it’s easy for the customer to digest quickly is one thing: making sure it’s appealing enough to convert is another.

But there’s no reason you can’t have fantastic listings content on Amazon. To make sure each listing cuts through and converts, here are 10 things to consider.

### 1. Know your brand style

Every brand needs a style guide for their content: an authority for spellings, fonts, colours image layouts, content dos and don’ts, and overall brand voice.

This promotes consistency across all your brand content, across all platforms, and across multiple offices.

It’s worth adding a section to your style guide for your Amazon listings content, so all your teams know how your titles should be written, how many bullets a listing should have and how you format them, how many images and videos you feature, etc.

Cristian Avendaño, Senior Content Expert at e-Comas, says: "While Amazon strives to standardise detail pages, there’s still some freedom for brands to showcase their style - especially on enhanced content, such as the A+ description and the Brand Store."

### 2. Use a syndication platform

The bigger your catalogue, the more likely you are to need software to manage it.

Syndication software (we like both Salsify and Channel Engine) provides a single source of truth for all your listings content.

Every product you sell can be pushed to every marketplace you sell on, using the same information, to ensure the greatest consistency – not only in elements like spelling and style, but also pricing and localisation. Need to update some information, or add a new product variation? Just do it once and it will be pushed out to all marketplaces.

### 3. Do your keyword research

Keyword research is vital to ensure your listings are searchable, fully optimised and targeted towards the right audience. And it’s so much quicker and more effective if you use tools.

We use industry-standard software, such as Helium10, to carry out front-end and back-end keyword research, which can be integrated seamlessly into your listings text.

### 4. Get a content audit

Are you advertising, but the traffic isn’t converting? Or you’re just not sure your eCommerce content is up to scratch?

We recommend getting an audit of your existing Amazon content: it can show what you’re doing well, as well as where you’re going wrong. An expert agency (like e-Comas) will guide you on areas of improvement, unseen opportunities, and help ensure your brand voice is consistent and compelling everywhere you sell.

### 5. Use the best images

There’s little excuse these days for not having fantastic photos of your products. A good range of images, showing your products at different angles and being used in different ways, makes the difference between content that converts and content that doesn’t convert.

Amazon’s AI image enhancement tools can help you produce imagery of your items being used in context, which are always super-compelling for shoppers. High-quality, consistent images are key – and check to make sure they’re displaying correctly, too.

### 6. And video as well!

Video is proven to improve conversion on Amazon listings.

A short video of your product in action, or demonstrating how it works, gives the shopper confidence in your product and in your brand: it boosts your credibility.

### 7. Enhance your content with A+

A+ content is the ‘below the fold’ enriched content below the description. It’s a fantastic opportunity to sell your product with compelling, branded content, and tell your brand story. 

It almost guarantees a higher conversion rate: customers look for A+ content when they’re researching products on Amazon. [Amazon says](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/a-content) A+ can increase sales by 8%; paid-for Premium A+ enhanced content can increase them by 20%.

### 8. Tell your Brand story

Did someone say ‘brand story’…?

Shoppers are very interested in where their purchases come from, particularly if it’s a small company, family-owned, or has interesting ties to its locality. 

By telling your customers who you are and why you sell what you sell, you can appeal to their emotional side, and make them more inclined to buy from you – not just once, but as a repeat customer. Your brand story is a powerful marketing tool.

### 9. ...And create your Brand Store

We’re big believers in the power of Amazon’s Brand Store tool: we’ve seen the way it helps our clients convert traffic.

The Brand Store is effectively your shop window within Amazon. It’s a free tool, which allows shoppers to click through to all your products – a captive audience. You can design the Brand Store in your brand style and colours, and theme collections by product type, or audience, or season – however you like.

### 10. Continuously review your product pages

We mentioned earlier that you should check your images are displaying correctly: that’s just one element that needs to be periodically quality-checked. Another is keywords: keywords can often slip or increase in relevance, so what works one week might not work the next.

The truth is your pages need continuous review, to make sure they’re up-to-date and fully optimised.

We recommend using an agency: not only can they keep track of your listings quality and consistency, they can troubleshoot, and move fast to fix problems as they arise, so that your listings stay active.

At e-Comas, we’re used to handling these issues, liaising with Amazon’s support team as necessary. We navigate the complexities of Amazon as well as most other eCommerce platforms, ensuring your issues are resolved swiftly and effectively.
