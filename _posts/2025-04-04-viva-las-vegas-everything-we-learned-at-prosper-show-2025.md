*Jérôme having a great time at Prosper, as always*

We just got back from Vegas, where we attended the best Prosper Show ever!

With more people attending, more connections made and more talking than ever before, for us it was the most successful show ever… and the Prosper Show organisers agree, confirming that it was the biggest yet.

We learned so much. Here’s a little round-up of our highlights from this year’s show.

### More marketplaces

The Prosper Show is usually quite Amazon-focused, so we were delighted to see more marketplaces making a big splash: Walmart as well as Shein, BestBuy and loads of others. 

Amazon was naturally out in force, with many services showcased at Prosper: Ads, Shipping, Veeqo inventory management, and more.

### Expandables Assemble

Move over Avengers, Justice League, Ghostbusters… The Expandables joined forces at the show, with an incredible-looking themed stand to help sellers learn how to expand their business globally. 

Made up of our own CEO [Jérôme de Guigné](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromedeguigne-amazon-expert/) (Captain Expansion), YLT Translations’ [Jana Krekic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jana-krekic-04739227/)(Colonel Localization), and AVASK’s [Melanie Shabangu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-v-katsaris-28bb3524/) (General Compliance), the superhero team donned capes, helped brands and caused a stir at Prosper.

### The AI Hackathon

Jérôme was a team captain for the Ultimate AI Hackathon, a coding workshop that used the best brains in eCommerce to build two brilliant AI agents: a legal translator, and a pick-up artist (just for fun). Emceed by [Brent Wees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentwees/), the raucously fun event saw nine teams compete in the build. It’s amazing what they achieved in 45 minutes.

Jérôme says: “AI was everywhere at the Prosper Show, and it shows that our jobs are going to evolve. The less curious or open to change will disappear.”

Brent Wees says: “The biggest challenge of the Hackathon is ensuring three things: are we making the challenge inclusive enough so that every participant can help their team? Is everyone learning something new they can start to apply right away? And are we having fun? 

"If the captains and I hit these three marks, we always have positive feedback from those who join us. I consider that a huge win.”

### Simple Modern: Becoming the undisputed #2

The Prosper keynotes are always amazing. One of our favourites was from Simple Modern, who shared how they used Amazon to become the main competitor of the famous drinkware brand Stanley: by finding out the most heavily used search terms for Stanley’s most popular product, and then turning back to customer data to build a product that met the same criteria. 

Then they targeted those same keywords in their Amazon advertising. This way, when Stanley went out-of-stock, they were able to take considerable market share.

### Not just any keynote: the Channel Key note

Another favourite keynote was from agency Channel Key, where founder [Wendi Mathis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendimathisheld/) led a discussion on ‘Forecasting the Future: Expert Strategies for Amazon Inventory Management’ along with The Step2 Company’s [Kelly Pezley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-pezley/). 

They shared insights on improving forecasting accuracy, staying in stock without excess, and making smarter inventory decisions. An incredible duo.

Wendi Mathis says: "It was an honor to speak at this year’s Prosper Show. The Prosper team curated strong content and a great lineup of speakers, and the attendees came ready to learn, ask thoughtful questions, and share insights – which made the session even more impactful."

### Unlocking data with AMC

The Prosper sessions on subjects around advertising are always the most popular, and this year we noticed a particular buzz for Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC). We’re not surprised: AMC gives brands the keys to their data, allowing them to make smarter, data-based decisions around their advertising and targeting. 

Our friends [Joe Shelerud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeshelerud/) of Ad Advance and [Sreenath Reddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sreenathkreddy/) of Intentwise gave a particularly powerful presentation on AMC in the Amazon Ads booth. As a data-specialist agency, we’re delighted to see more brands realising the power of AMC.

[Matt Snyder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-snyder-amazon/), from agency Brands Excel, says: "This year marks my sixth time attending Prosper, and each year it continues to deliver even more value. The sessions consistently address the latest trends and challenges sellers face in the ever-evolving Amazon landscape.

"What’s been most valuable to me over the years, though, are the friendships I've built within the industry – relationships that continue to provide insight and inspiration through ongoing conversations and shared experiences.

"This year was especially memorable, as my son, [Kenton Snyder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kentonsnyder/), gave his first presentation at Prosper, speaking on Amazon DSP & AMC Incrementality.

"Events like Prosper are a great reminder of how sellers – regardless of maturity or experience – can continue to level up and grow through community and shared knowledge."

Jérôme says: "We never miss the Prosper Show, it's so much fun and this year's was the best yet. It's an incredible opportunity to learn, to share what we know, and mostly just to have fun and become close friends with all the great people working in the eCommerce industry. Big thanks to the organisers for such a productive and memorable show."

### Keep the momentum going

Jérôme says: “We never miss the Prosper Show, it’s so much fun and this year’s was the best yet. It’s an incredible opportunity to learn, to share what we know, and mostly just to have fun and become close friends with all the great people working in the eCommerce industry. Big thanks to the organisers for such a productive and memorable show.”

Shows like Prosper are priceless for building lasting connections. So, it’s important to keep building on these after the event, advises Abe Chomali, Founder at XP Strategy.

“Prosper is almost overwhelming, but in a good way. With hundreds of brands, partners and business connections to see and talk with, three days isn’t anywhere near enough time to get it all in,” he says.

“One thing I discussed on stage is super relevant as I get back home and re-focus on business: Don’t let new connections and discussions fade away once you get back! Build on everything you’ve seen and discussed all week at Prosper.”

### We're off to the Wynn

Next year the Prosper Show is moving to the Wynn, Las Vegas' legendary resort and casino.

[York Schwab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/york-schwab-bb55a719/), one of the organisers of the Prosper Show, says: "We are extremely excited to move Prosper over to the Wynn and offer an elevated onsite experience – from amazing deals on their rooms, to a sublime conference center. It’s going to be amazing!"

**We'll see you all there on 10-12 March 2026!**
