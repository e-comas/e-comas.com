We’re back from an incredible edition of unBoxed, held in Nashville, Tennessee over 10-12 November.

The annual conference is always one of the biggest highlights of the eCommerce calendar, with Amazon Ads making most of its announcements for the coming year. But this year’s show was particularly rich with innovations: dozens of new products, services and features have hit the headlines.

Our CEO Jérôme de Guigné and CTO Claudiu Clement both attended. Here are some of the big themes and main learnings that emerged over the three days.

### Relevance, transparency, and ease of use

The Amazon Ads team talked about the ability to reach extended audiences through all channels. Amazon Ads says it can connect advertisers with 90% of all US households.

e-Comas CEO Jérôme de Guigné says: “This means Amazon Ads can provide solutions through its many channels for all and any brands, of any size.”

One of the big announcements was that video is coming to Sponsored Products. Brands large and small will be able to place video ads in search, one of Amazon’s most effective spaces.

Amazon Ads is also bringing out Sponsored Brands Collections, which will allow brands to advertise multiple, related products in just one ad.

A new feature of interest to big-name brands will be Sponsored Brands Reserve Share of Voice, which will allow fixed-price pre-purchase of top-of-search placement for branded keywords.

Jérôme says: “More ads formats, more features, and all of that available to the small brands and the large ones, to people who can code but also the ones who can’t… that means advertising needs to be as efficient and as simple as possible.”

### Full funnel campaigns

In day 1’s first keynote session, Amazon Ads Senior Vice President Paul Kotas said: “We’re building on last year’s improvements and taking further steps toward our goal of making it simple to run effective full-funnel advertising.”

Full-funnel campaigns were a big topic for the conference, as Amazon Ads announced that from next year, you’ll be able to create and manage ads for different parts of the funnel all in one place and linked to each other.

It’s launching a tool, called Full-funnel Campaigns, which will recommend an ads set-up across Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, display ads, and streaming TV. The tool will automatically, continuously adjust budgets and audiences using Amazon insights.

It’s also launching a new unified Campaign Manager: a single Ads platform, where you’ll be able to create and manage DSP and Sponsored Ads on the same interface, with the same login. “Amazing! And so logical,” says Jérôme.

“Amazon Ads is improving every day to provide more data, more insights and the understanding of what is happening with your spend – to ensure you spend better, wiser and with better results.”

### AI-driven efficiency

Amazon unveiled a couple of new AI agents at the show.

First up: Creative Agent, which will analyse Brand Stores, product pages and websites to come up with USPs for your products, then generates ideas and imagery based on those.

Amazon also announced Ads Agent, which can be communicated with in natural language to handle your ad campaigns, across multiple accounts.

For example, you can ask: “Show me all campaigns with budget delivery rate below 75%. Increase ad group bids by 20%”. and it will automatically give you answers.

Amazon stressed that “this isn't just about automation: it's about augmenting human expertise with AI that understands the nuances of advertising strategy, transforming how advertisers work and drive results.”

It also announced that sellers will be able to advertise against the AI prompts in Rufus: a chance to showcase your brand where shoppers are asking questions and getting conversational answers.

### AI in AMC

As data specialists, the e-Comas team were excited about the potential of AI in Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC).

Amazon announced that the AI AMC Agent will generate AMC queries in natural language, from prompts such as ‘Write a query showing which campaigns drive highest value customers’, or ‘Show which products drive long-term sales among new-to-brand customers’. 

“This means analytics teams will be able to focus on strategy rather than getting bogged down in code,” says Claudiu Clement.

**“unBoxed was really the perfect opportunity to see the evolution of the eCommerce world in action,” says Jérôme.**

“I don’t think we’ve ever seen so many huge announcements in one show. Amazon is giving us amazing tools, democratising the entire process of selling online, allowing small brands who have never had big budgets to compete on a level playing field. At the same time they’re creating incredible opportunities for big brands.

“Amazon is shaping the future of eCommerce, and we’re so excited to see these innovations take effect in the next 12 months.”
