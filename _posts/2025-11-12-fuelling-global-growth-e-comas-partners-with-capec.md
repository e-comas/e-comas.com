At e-Comas, we’re all about helping ambitious Amazon and eCommerce brands go global — navigating the challenges of things like cross-border logistics, localisation and marketplace compliance to reach millions of new customers around the world.

But one challenge many fast-growing sellers face, which has little to do with strategy or skill, is capital.

Expanding into new markets requires inventory, marketing investment and operational runway. For many brands, that can become a bottleneck.

That’s why we’re thrilled to announce our new partnership with [CapEc – eCommerce Capital Partners](https://capec.io/), a leading provider of flexible, non-dilutive funding solutions for digital brands.

Together, we’re helping sellers access the capital and expertise they need to scale faster and smarter across global marketplaces.

### Why we partnered with CapEc

Our mission has always been to make global expansion simple, strategic and scalable. But even the best expansion strategy can stall without sufficient capital to back it up.

CapEc specialises in providing growth capital tailored specifically for eCommerce sellers. Financing that helps brands invest in inventory, advertising and global expansion without giving up equity or ownership.

By combining their capital solutions with our hands-on marketplace expertise, brands now have access to a complete growth playbook, where strategy and funding work hand in hand to unlock global opportunities.

“Many successful eCommerce brands reach a point where they’re ready to expand internationally but lack the capital or know-how to do it efficiently,” says Jérôme de Guigné, Founder and CEO of e-Comas. “Our partnership with CapEc bridges that gap, empowering sellers to scale faster, smarter and more profitably across global marketplaces.”

### What this means for eCommerce brands

With the e-Comas + CapEc partnership, sellers can:

* Access non-dilutive growth funding: Secure flexible capital to support marketplace expansion, inventory, and campaigns.
* Expand into major global marketplaces: Tap into our international team of ex-brand directors, ex-Amazonians and operational experts’ knowledge in all major online marketplaces.
* Grow with confidence: Get support at every stage of your global expansion journey.
* Scale sustainably: Use data-driven strategies and financial runway to expand profitably, not just quickly.

### Funding meets global expertise

Our partnership with CapEc is a shared commitment to helping brands reach their full global potential.

CapEc’s CEO, Ndav Gorlicki, adds: “We’re genuinely excited to partner with e-Comas; their hands-on approach to scaling brands and deep understanding of the Amazon ecosystem perfectly complements what we do at CapEc. 

“e-Comas has built a reputation for helping sellers turn data and strategy into real growth, and together we can now back that growth with the right capital structure. This partnership means our clients can access not only expert guidance on how to scale, but also the funding to make it happen.”

### Ready to go global?

If you’re an eCommerce brand ready to scale beyond borders, now’s the time to take the next step.
