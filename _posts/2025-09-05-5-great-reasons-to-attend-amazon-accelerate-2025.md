Amazon Accelerate returns once again to Seattle, WA in just a couple of weeks. e-Comas will be attending – as well as speaking at the show.

Here’s all the reasons you should put 16-18 September in your calendar, and [book your tickets to Accelerate 2025](https://www.amazonaccelerate.com/event/d2925564-693f-4a85-94f1-ca2ad919a832/summary), today.

### You’ll get to see us!

It’s the sixth edition of the famous show, taking place at the Summit Building of the Seattle Convention Center. We love attending: as the major Amazon-focused show, organised by Amazon itself, it offers unrivalled access to the Amazon team and their vast wealth of knowledge, as well as their huge partner network.

This year we’re guests of AVASK, bringing a Europe-breaking element to the show’s largely American audience. You can spot us around the show, or find us on the AVASK stand, Booth 56, happy to talk to any US sellers who want to expand globally using Amazon’s unrivalled European presence.

Or you can watch us give a presentation on that subject…

### You can learn from the experts (us) how to expand into Europe

We’ll be speaking at the show: our founder and CEO Jérôme de Guigné will be chatting with AVASK’s Alexandra R about how to unlock the billion-dollar opportunity of selling on Amazon in Europe.

We’ll talk about the strong growth position of the EU and UK markets, and how to manage cross-border operations smoothly, as well as:

* The #1 myth about selling in Europe (and how to bust it)
* The ways Amazon makes it surprisingly easy to enter seven EU countries at once
* 5 reasons the EU and UK is Amazon’s best kept growth secret.

AVASK’s session ‘Beyond the US: Unlocking Europe's Billion-Dollar Opportunity’ will take place at 2:45pm on 16 September – don’t miss us.

Jérôme de Guigné says: “For sellers who are feeling the pressure of the competitive US Amazon marketplace, the EU and UK offers a major growth opportunity: over 500 million potential customers and a billion-dollar eCommerce market.

“In our session we're going to dive into why the EU and UK markets are ripe for growth, and share valuable strategies, from logistics and compliance to localised marketing tactics. We promise real insight and next steps to take – you’ll have a lot to think about.”

### You can also learn from Amazon themselves

Accelerate has the best access to Amazon’s experts, many of whom will be leading the show’s General Sessions.

They include Dharmesh Mehta, VP of Amazon Worldwide Selling Partner Services; Alex Berry, Director of Amazon Global Logistics; and Nadya Dhalla, General Manager of Supply Chain by Amazon. Expect to be inspired.

Amazon usually launches new tools and products at Accelerate, so you’ll be first to hear what’s coming next.

### You can get one-to-one support on Amazon topics

One of the highlights of Accelerate – of any e-Commerce show, in fact – is the Seller Cafe, where sellers can get one-to-one help from Amazon experts in a 40-minute consultation session.

The Seller Cafe offers access to specialists across different areas to help sellers actually solve their real problems using Amazon, or get support using Amazon’s programs. Sellers can optimise their operations, troubleshoot persistent issues or learn how to use new tools in real time and in person.

Our CEO Jérôme says: "This is the golden value from the show. You can unblock millions in sales by having the right conversation with the right person at Accelerate."

### You can connect with partners and peers in new, imaginative ways

It’s not just access to Amazon: Accelerate offers unrivalled chances to connect with Amazon’s partner network, including agencies, third-party tools and service providers.

Accelerate 2025 has the largest ‘Partner Connect’ area to date, with dozens of presentations and one-to-one consultations available.

There are lots of other chances to learn too, including, new for 2025, collaborating with other sellers in Breakout Roundtable sessions, and peer-led presentations and networking sessions on the Seller Spotlight Stage.

### ‘We’ll see you there’

e-Comas CEO Jérôme says: "Why do we go to Accelerate? Because it's an amazing place for sellers, specifically those who want to learn about selling better, and those who want to meet with key Amazon people to unlock issues on their accounts.

“From a personal perspective, I love Accelerate for the chances to collaborate with our industry friends. I'm super excited to be speaking with Alex from AVASK about how to unlock the million dollar business of Amazon Europe. It's a great opportunity to learn and grow, and specifically grow your business.

“If you're around, just ping us a message or come to the AVASK stand and let’s talk. We'll see you there.”
