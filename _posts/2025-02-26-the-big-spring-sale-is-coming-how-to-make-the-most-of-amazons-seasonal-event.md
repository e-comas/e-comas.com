**Amazon's next big event day is fast approaching.**

Tiding us over till Prime Day, the Amazon Spring Sale is a great opportunity to tap into shoppers' seasonal desires, boost your revenue and attract new customers.

Here's everything you need to know: What the Amazon Spring Sale is, why you should get involved, and how to strategise for success on Amazon. 

### What is the Amazon Spring Sale?

The Amazon Spring Sale - also known as Amazon Spring Deal Days, and the Big Spring Sale - is a two-day, non-Prime-exclusive event, marketed by Amazon as a chance for shoppers to update their wardrobe, their home, their garden and their technology. 

This is the second Spring Sale: the first took place on 25-26 March 2024. Dates have not yet been announced for the 2025 event, but we think it'll be the week commencing 24 March.

### Why should sellers get involved in the Amazon Spring Sale? 

The Spring Sale is unusual among Amazon's events in that it has a clearly seasonal theme. If you're selling summer fashion, garden furniture, outdoor electronics or cleaning products, it's definitely worth tapping into. 

But it's a time of year when people like to spend money, coming [after the post-Christmas retail slump of January and February](https://www.confiz.com/blog/best-and-worst-months-for-retail-sales/): so whatever you're selling on Amazon, with the right strategy and messaging you can make the Spring Sale work for you. 

### What kind of products sell well in the Amazon Spring Sale?

Fashion, homeware, cleaning, organising, garden and Easter products all did really well in [last year's Spring Sale](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-big-spring-sale-best-deals), for the fairly obvious reason mentioned above: it's a seasonal event that taps into the consumer spring mindset.

But technology did well too - it always sells well in Amazon events, regardless of the time of year - so if you're selling tech it's worth being involved. 

Sport and fitness equipment, beauty and haircare, and toys and baby categories did well too. 

### What kind of deals and discounts can sellers use for the Amazon Spring Sale? 

You can apply all these deals to your products for the Spring Sale: 

**Lightning Deals:** Quick-fire offers that last for four-six hours. They're featured prominently in search results and on the Spring Deals homepage, and they're particularly good if you've got excess inventory to sell. 

**Best Deals:** Also called 7-Day Deals, Best Deals last for a week, badged as a 'limited time deal' on the Today's Deals and Spring Deals pages. 

**Coupons:** Shoppers love coupons, as they give extra money off at the checkout. They have to click the coupon to apply the discount. You can apply a coupon to one product, or 'link coupons' to products across your store. 

**Prime Exclusive Discounts:** Spring Deals Day isn't a Prime-only event, but as there are [200 million Prime members globally](https://backlinko.com/amazon-prime-users), they're a huge audience worth targeting. The exclusive discount can help your product stand out among the rest. 

**Sale Price:** The Sale Price discount shows your sale price against the normal price of your item, and you can apply it for up to 30 days.

### Are there any Amazon Spring Sale deadlines to know about? 

For Lightning and Best Deals, you will need to submit your deals by 16 March in Europe, and 17 March in the US.

### Do you have a recommended ad strategy for the Amazon Spring Sale? 

It's fairly simple: make sure you increase your budget to adjust for higher traffic during the event days, because more impressions means your budget will get used faster. You also need to plan your inventory carefully to make sure you can meet extra demand.

And, naturally, we recommend you push the ASINs that will be on promotion during the event: don't waste your budget on ASINs that don't have deals. 

We recommend a mix of Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Display on your deal ASINs.

As well as applying deals on the event days themselves, you can use the lead-in and lead-out times to maximise your Amazon sales: advertising around the event is a bit less costly than during the event, and you'll catch shoppers who are checking for early or late deals. 

We always recommend using data to plan your campaigns around event days. Try using the Tentpole Phase Analysis report in Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) to find out the best advertising combinations to drive profit around sales days - [read our blog about it here](https://e-comas.com/2023/12/04/reading-the-tentpole-how-to-build-momentum-for-your-amazon-ads-after-black-friday.html). 

### Any other Amazon Spring Sale advice for sellers?

As a seasonal sale event, think about how you can use the time of year to sell to the customer. 

The spring selling clichés are shoppers refreshing their wardrobe, updating their garden or doing a big spring clean, but there are so many creative ways to market your products for the season, some as simple as using sunshine in your images. 

Amazon's free marketing opportunities are absolutely great for ensuring your overall brand echoes your Spring Deals. Refresh your Brand Store for the season, use lots of spring/summer imagery and messaging for the event, and try using [Amazon Posts, Amazon Inspire and Amazon Live](https://e-comas.com/2024/10/01/feeling-inspired-how-to-use-amazons-social-tools-to-boost-your-marketing.html) if you're selling in the US.
