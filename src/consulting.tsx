            <p>Defining an eCommerce strategy consists of different steps:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Audit: we study your presence, the health of your accounts and
                the market dynamics, the size of your competition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Workshop: usually for a full day where we will deliver the
                results of our audit, a gap analysis and train you on the key
                success factors to win in eCommerce.
              </li>
              <li>
                Deliverable: a clear strategy on where to play, with which
                account, which pricing &amp; portfolio strategy, and in which
                timing.
              </li>
            </ul>
