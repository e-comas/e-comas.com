              Defining an <ECommerce /> strategy consists of different steps:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Audit</strong>: we study your presence, the health of
                your accounts and the market dynamics, the size of your
                competition.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Workshop</strong>: usually for a full day where we will
                deliver the results of our audit, a gap analysis and train you
                on the key success factors to win in <ECommerce />.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deliverable</strong>: a clear strategy on where to play,
                with which account, which pricing &amp; portfolio strategy, and
                in what timeframe.
              </li>
            </ul>
