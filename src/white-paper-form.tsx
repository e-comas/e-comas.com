              Is lack of resource and knowledge holding back your Amazon sales?
            </p>
            <p>
              In partnership with the eBusiness Institute, we at e-Comas
              surveyed brands that sell on Amazon to find out their biggest
              issues with using the <ECommerce /> giant. The results of that
              survey are in this white paper â€“ together with our own expert
              advice on how you can streamline your organisation and support
              your operations team to make those issues a thing of the past.
